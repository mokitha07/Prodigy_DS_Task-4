Road Accident Data Analysis Project 🛣️📊

I'm excited to share the successful completion of my latest data analysis project!
In this task, I analyzed a Road Accident Dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to accident causes and hotspots.

🔍 Key Focus Areas:
🚦 Road Conditions: Wet, Dry, Icy
🌧️ Weather Impact: Clear, Rainy, Foggy
🕒 Time of Day: Morning, Evening, Night
📍 Location-based Hotspots: Using map visualizations (heatmaps)
📊 Visualizations Created:
Hourly accident trends
Accidents by road and weather conditions
Geographic accident hotspots using interactive heatmaps
🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas – Data handling & cleaning
matplotlib & seaborn – Static visualizations
folium – Interactive maps and heatmaps
IDE: Visual Studio Code
Techniques: Data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization
